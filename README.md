# Backyard Brains Heart and Brain Spiker Box Experiments
Interactive examples ('experiments') using the Heart & Brain Spiker Box hardware from Backyard Brains (BYB)

## About the Hardware
The [Heart and Brain Spiker Box](https://backyardbrains.com/products/heartandbrainspikerbox) from [Backyard Brains](https://backyardbrains.com/) enables scientists of all ages to conduct single-channel ECG (💓) and EEG (🧠) experiments. 

## About the Experiments
A fully grown adult working at MathWorks somehow [received a Backyard Brains kit](https://blog.backyardbrains.com/2018/06/matlab/). Ever since, MathWorkers around the globe have begged their managers to spend some working hours with this educational hardware. Every now and then, one of the experiments works 😏. Those are the ones that go here!
